# OAuth.Mono

The goal of this repository is to implement a full *Mono* compatible service for OAuth authentication, with a custom *Identity* model. This service can run on *Docker*, that's nice.

For the moment, the identity repository consists in an in-memory store. Need some time to add it a real storage runtime...
